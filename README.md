# Crypto-Arbitrage
UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 3 Module 3 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I sorted through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase and applied the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

I created a Jupyter notebook that contains code for data collection from CSV data, preparation of datasets for analysis by cleaningmissing/erroneous data, and analysis through summary and visualizations toselect time periods for arbitrage opportunities.

## Technologies

This project uses Python programming language, Jupyter notebook, the libraries and functions associated, etc.

## Installation Guide

Make sure to install Jupyter notebook (comes with Anaconda)

## Usage

General information about your analysis: Overall, the arbotrage was significantly positive/higher in the beginning of the time period vs the end of the time period (bitstamp prices were lower than coinbase's at the beginning)

Information about the datasets:
    Names: bitstamp.csv and coinbase.csv
    Beginning date: 01/01/2018
    End date: 03/31/2018

Libraries used in analysis: pandas and matplotlib libraries
