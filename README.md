# Crypto-Arbitrage
UC Fintech Bootcamp Challenge 3 Module 3 Challenge assignment for the UC Berkeley Fintech Bootcamp.

In this challenge, I sorted through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase and applied the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

I created a Jupyter notebook that contains code for data collection from CSV data, preparation of datasets for analysis by cleaningmissing/erroneous data, and analysis through summary and visualizations toselect time periods for arbitrage opportunities.
